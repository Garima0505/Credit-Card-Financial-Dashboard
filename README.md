## 📝 Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

## 📚 Overview
In this project, we explored four primary datasets:

* cc_add.csv
* credit_card.csv
* cust_add.csv
* customer.csv

These datasets were analyzed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into customer spending habits, credit utilization, and more.

## 🔍 Project Breakdown

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning 🧼
The first step involved collecting data from the reports as mentioned earlier. The datasets were cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data entries, and inconsistencies. This crucial step ensures the accuracy of our analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔬
We conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis through SQL to understand the distribution of various features, such as:

- **_Customer Demographics:_** Age, gender, income levels, etc.

- **_Transaction Details:_** Frequency, average transaction amount, and category-wise spending.

- **_Credit Utilization:_** Analysis of credit limits and balances.

### 3. Data Visualization 📈
To make the findings more accessible, we created a series of visualizations:

- _**Bar Charts & Pie Charts:**_ For demographic distributions and spending categories.

- _**Histograms:**_ To display the distribution of transaction amounts.

- _**Line Graphs:**_ Showing trends in spending over time.
These visualizations help easily understand complex data and spot significant patterns.
